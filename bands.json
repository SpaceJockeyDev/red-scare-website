Ya know the quiet person that sits in the corner that only speaks up once a year, but when they do, they say something inspiring, thoughtful, and profound?  That’s Arms Aloft. Not the busiest group on the planet, but when the band materializes, the punk scene listens. They are loud and proud socialists (Alright, alright, alright, just the way we like ‘em), and if there’s ever some wacky Right Wing takeover in America *looks around, laughs nervously* they’re coming for Arms Aloft first. But good luck taking on this band, as they’re smart, scrappy, and they literally eat from garbage cans. What a time to be barely alive! - TJ"

The recordings are definitely not your typical punk acoustic faire as he works with a full band of deviant collaborators, and the live show has been described as Andy Kaufman goes Kafka, but with songs about your mom. - TJ"

They’ve done the Warped Tour, played Tokyo with Taylor Swift and Jay Z (wish we were lying), toured the UK with Alkaline Trio, etc.  These humble kids have been on magazine covers, heard on commercial radio, and the bass player even owns an actual bulldozer.

Devin and his various skin-challenged serpentine cohorts spent years crisscrossing this great nation charming the children with their music so effortlessly, it was as though they were in baskets in an open air market in an Indiana Jones movie or something.  Seriously though, Cobra Skulls are the most old school meets new school political horror self-reflective ophidiophilic stripped-down acoustic lushly instrumental melodic screechy deadly serious total party band you’ll ever meet. \n\nSadly, you won’t have too many chances to meet them anymore.  Pulled up from their den by Red Scare, the Cobra Skulls gained enough attention in the national punk scene that Fat Wreck Chords decided to do what it does best, namely stroll through the Red Scare orchards and harvest the ripest fruits to take home for themselves.  And the Skulls were exactly the ripe and fecund fruits that wanted, needed to be plucked. \n\nHowever, irony is a cruel mistress, for this seemingly game-changing move to a larger label only inspired the ever-unpredictable Devin to look at the bigger picture and make some changes and do some fruit plucking himself.  What does that mean?  Long story short he’s a farmer that sells oranges now and as a result they barely play anymore.  But when they do, they scream and croon in Spanish and English, and if you stand very still and can ignore the infrastructural collapse of Reno as it bursts around you like a plague boil, you can hear the serpents slithering up from the sewers, once again entranced by the singular siren song of the Cobra Skulls, amassing and preparing to take over the whole fucking world. - BK"

Forged in the deepest subterranean mines of Cleveland, Ohio, The Sidekicks were one of those incredible indie rock/punk/pop/wizard combos that everyone agrees made some of the best music of the millennium.  No, really.  Their last few records were all over “best of” lists, but who cares now, right?  They’re dead. \n\n Red Scare snapped up The Sidekicks when they were wee pups and properly put out their first album, So Long, Soggy Dog (which was a tribute to a punk house), all on the strength of a cell phone video of guitarist/vocalist Steve Ciolek playing the bass solo of Rancid’s “Maxwell Murder” FLAWLESSLY while sitting on a couch in a hoodie in his underwear and participating in the rather reckless mosh pit that his homies had started on said couch. \n\n From there, he and drummer Matt Climer have cycled through some members, growing and expanding in unexpected ways, finally coming out of their chrysalis state on their album Awkward Breeds as a band with more in common with Band of Horses and Flaming Lips than Rancid.  They signed to Epitaph, put out even more great records and then they broke up because you didn’t come see them. Now they all work at Skyline Chili in Cincinnati because just like the other greatest thing to come out of Cleveland, LeBron, their own city has turned on them just for being incredible and daring to dream. - BK"
