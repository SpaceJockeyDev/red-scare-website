Sometimes he goes solo and sometimes he soars with a dubious crew called the Wandering Birds. He’s done a couple LPs and some 7”s with Red Scare, and it’s all pretty freaky stuff: songs about torture, songs about drugs, songs about pervs, songs about serial killers, and songs about your mom. The recordings are definitely not your typical punk acoustic faire as he works with a full band of deviant collaborators, and the live show has been described as Andy Kaufman goes Kafka, but with songs about your mom."
